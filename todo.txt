MAKING A GAME

=== Definitions: === 
-Atom group: the bunch of atoms between two control rod slots
-Atom column: one vertical column inside of an atom group
-Slot: A place where an atom (group) or a control rod can be

=== Setup: === 
-Make slots for atoms and control rods. The slot places are fixed, but the slots can be empty or filled.
    -Atoms are toggled on/off with UraniumAtom.hasAtom
    -Make a method in the class to toggle atom groups on and off
        -Calculate the positions of atoms and blah blah
            -Atoms are marked with this.atomGroup for easier filtering
-Make an object of starting stats, which can be upgraded later.

=== Player starts with: === 
    -Game starts in start screen
    -two groups of atoms, the two centermost ones
        -each group has three columns of atoms
        -each group has 15 rows of atoms
    -one control rod, the center one

=== Max upgrades are: === 
    -six columns of atom groups, each group has 6x30 atoms (total 36x30)
    -five control rods

=== Shop: === 
    -atoms to a group. The centermost slot is filled first, prioritize left/top one if there is multiple slots equally close to center
        -ctrl+click to buy 5
        -shift+click to buy 10
    -Control rods. Same logic, centermost first.
    -Can the stuff be bought whenever or does the reactor need to be shut down first? / to be decided later
    -Max water flow rate

=== UI elements that will be revealed in time: ===
    -Meter when x amount of heat is reached
    -Power output display when x+y amount of heat is reached
    -Amount of money when x+y+z amount of heat is reached
    -Water speed valve appears when buying 5th water speed upgrade.
    -Link rods button appears when second rod is bought

=== Economy: === 
    -"Money" is the amount of energy produced
    -Game money unit is a nuclear euro, eg "Neuro", plural "Neuri", symbol "n€"
    -Need to think of an increasing price ramp
    -New atom group should be relatively expensive

=== Gameplay features to add: ===
    -!!!!!Save/load game locally!!!!!
        -Three save slots?
    -Control the speed of water
        -Faster max speed via upgrades
        -Bubbles' speed is altered with this
        -And of course heat transfer
    -Water moves energy out of the screen, calculate how much and give "money" to Player
    -Hotter water is exponentially more expensive than cold water, this encourages the player to build heat instead of running the reactor cold
    -Better game over mechanic. The atoms should melt at a certain point... Or does the water explode? Or both?
        -Prettier boom animation
        -What happens when game over? 
            -Not a hc insta kill.
            -Prestige?
                -Some task must be completed to prestige. Max power output? Blow up once? Different for every prestige?
                -What should be better after prestige?
                    -Water heat capacity?
                    -Collision probability neutrons-atoms?
                    -Control rod slowing probability?
            -Lose some shit and try again?
                -Atoms?
                -Money?
                -Rods?
                -Make sure to not reduce anything to less than new game amount
    -Degrading atoms that need replacing? MAYBE later...
        -Automatic healing of atoms when they're cooled a lot?
        -And/or buy atom healing?

=== Sound: ===
    -Minimal sfx
        -Geiger counter tick when neutron is spawned?
        -Alarm when going too hot
        -Steam sound when running warm
    -Music?
        -Maybe later, not a priority

=== UI: ===
    -Control rod sliders
    -Water speed slider
    -Menu
        *Entered with esc key. Pauses the game*
        -Start/restart
        -Save/load
        -Options
            -Turn visual-only graphics layers on/off
        -Tutorial on/off
    -Meter rework to make it's scale scale with more powerful reactor or max power reached? Must be tested.
    -Force widescreen aspect ratio (1.78:1). Move the simulation canvases to the right to make room for ui elements on the left.
    -Add stats and graphs
        -One of the last things to do

=== Tutorial: ===
    -A tutorial window will pause the game and show some text. Blink the according element (layer) on screen.
    -Window will appear on screen on start and when new stuff is unlocked.
    -Make a tutorial function with args:
        -Title
        -Text
        -Blinking layer (optional)
        -Tutorial window size
            -Or make it dynamic size?
        -Tutorial window position
