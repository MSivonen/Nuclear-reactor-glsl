MAKING A GAME

=== Definitions: === 
-Atom group: the bunch of atoms between two control rod slots
-Atom column: one vertical column inside of an atom group
-Slot: A place where an atom (group) or a control rod can be

=== Setup: === 
-Make slots for atoms and control rods. The slot places are fixed, but the slots can be empty or filled.
    -Atoms are toggled on/off with UraniumAtom.hasAtom
    -Make a method in the class to toggle atom groups on and off
        -Calculate the positions of atoms and blah blah
            -Atoms are marked with this.atomGroup for easier filtering
v-Make an object/class of starting stats, which can be upgraded later.

=== Player starts with: === 
v    -Game starts in start screen
v    -two groups of atoms, the two centermost ones
v        -each group has 6 columns of atoms
!        -each group has 15 rows of atoms - tweak it, they have 3 too little
v    -one control rod, the center one

=== Max upgrades are: === 
v    -six atom groups, each group has 6x30 atoms (total 36x30)
v    -five control rods

=== Shop: === 
    -atoms to a group. The centermost slot is filled first, prioritize left/top one if there is multiple slots equally close to center
v        -ctrl+click to buy 5
v        -shift+click to buy 10
v    -Control rods. Same logic, centermost first.
     -Can the stuff be bought whenever or does the reactor need to be shut down first? / to be decided later
v    -Max water flow rate

=== UI elements that will be revealed in time: ===
    -Temp meter when x amount of heat is reached
    -Power output display when y amount of power is reached
    -Amount of money when z amount of power is reached
    -Water speed valve appears when buying a water speed upgrade.

=== Economy: === 
v    -"Money" is scaled by the amount of energy produced
v    -Game money unit is a Mass Flow Euro, symbol is m with a dot on it "&#7745"
v    -Need to think of an increasing price ramp
v     -New atom group should be relatively expensive
    -Hide some shop items until previous is bought
        -Able to buy plutonium first, then californium, then uranium, water flow, atoms, atom groups

=== Gameplay features to add: ===
v    -!!!!!Save/load game locally!!!!!
v        -Three save slots?
v    -Control the speed of water
v        -Faster max speed via upgrades
v        -Bubbles' speed is altered with this
v        -And of course heat transfer
v    -Water moves energy out of the screen, calculate how much and generate power
v    -Hotter water is exponentially more expensive than cold water, this encourages the player to build heat instead of running the reactor cold
    -Better game over mechanic. The atoms should melt at a certain point... Or does the water explode? Or both?
v        -Prettier boom animation
        -What happens when game over? 
            -Not a hc insta kill.
            -Prestige?
                -Some task must be completed to prestige. Max power output? Blow up once? Different for every prestige?
                -What should be better after prestige?
                    -Water heat capacity?
                    -Collision probability neutrons-atoms?
                    -Control rod slowing probability?
            -Lose some shit and try again?
                -Atoms?
                -Money?
                -Rods?
                -Make sure to not reduce anything to less than new game amount
    -Degrading atoms that need replacing? MAYBE later...
        -Automatic healing of atoms when they're cooled a lot?
        -And/or buy atom healing?
    -Move uranium groups up/down?
    -Modifiers menu to start screen. Idk what modifiers I want yet.
        -Make them affect the game difficulty and amount of money earned.


=== Sound: ===
v    -Minimal sfx
v        -Ambient sounds when running
v            -Play/mix/overlap randomly, with random volumes (30%-100%) and pitches (+-15%)
v                    -electric-hum
v                    -high-energy-buzzing (this one with 50% lower volume than others)
v                    -industrial-hum
v                    -scifi-generator
v                    -steam-bubbles
v                    -steam-bubbles2
v            -Water sounds
v                -water_low for low flow
v                -water_high for high flow
v            -Steam sound when running warm
v                -Steam1_low for cool
v                -Steam3_mid for intermediate heat
v                -Steam2_highPitch for hot
v            -Water and steam sounds should blend/mix smoothly from lower to higher level sound. Do not stop the lower sound, but make it 30% quieter.
v        -Alarm when going too hot
v        -Explosion sound
v            -boom
v        -Button click sounds for ui
v            -click
        
    -Music?
        -Maybe later, not a priority

=== UI: ===
v    -Control rod sliders
v    -Water speed slider
v    -Menu
v        *Entered with esc key. Pauses the game*
v        -Start/restart
v        -Save/load
v        -Options
v            -Turn visual-only graphics layers on/off
        -Tutorial on/off
    -Meter rework to make it's scale scale with more powerful reactor or max power reached? Must be tested.
v   -Force widescreen aspect ratio (1.78:1). Move the simulation canvases to the right to make room for ui elements on the left.
    -Add stats and graphs
        -One of the last things to do

=== Tutorial: ===
    -A tutorial window will pause the game and show some text. Blink the according element (layer) on screen.
    -Window will appear on screen on start and when new stuff is unlocked.
    -Make a tutorial function with args:
        -Title
        -Text
        -Blinking layer (optional)
        -Tutorial window size
            -Or make it dynamic size?
        -Tutorial window position


=== Bugs/Fixes ===
-Make shader(s) to draw plutonium and californium. Put them to a layer right below atom cores.
